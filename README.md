The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is an AI-powered project designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of fatigue or drowsiness in drivers in real-time. The system leverages Computer Vision and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to monitor the driverâ€™s eye and facial behavior through a live video stream and trigger an alert if drowsiness is detected.
